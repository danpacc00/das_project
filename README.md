# Distributed Autonomous Systems A.Y. 2023/24 - Course Project

The code inside this repo implements the tasks required to tackle the project of the course of *Distributed Autonomous Systems* (2023/24 edition) of the faculty of *Automation Engineering* of the *University of Bologna*. According to the project assignment, two tasks must be accomplished:
1. Solve a logistic regression classification problem in a distributed way
2. Solve an aggregative optimization problem for a multi-robot system

Each task has been carried out independently from the other one, so the code for each task is fully self-contained. Repo structure has been devised accordingly, thus you can find the source code for task 1 under `task_1` and the one for task 2 under `task_2`.
